\paragraph*{Objective} \hfill \\
Aim of this experiment is to analyze a full wave recififer with an oscilloscope.
\paragraph*{Results and procedure} \hfill\\
Following values are given by:
\begin{align*}
R&= 1k\Omega	&	D&= 1N4001	&	V_{i}&=20sin(100\pi t)
\end{align*}
Following measurements were made using bot multimeter and oscilloscope:

\begin{align*}
&V_{i}= 13.87V\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{(AC)} \\
&i= 1.41mA\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{(AC)} \\
&V_{RL}=11.85 V\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{(DC)} \\
\end{align*}

\paragraph*{Conclusion} \hfill \\
